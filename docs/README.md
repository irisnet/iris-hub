IRIS network (a.k.a. IRISnet) aims to establish a technology foundation to fa- cilitate construction of next-generation distributed applications. By incorpo- rating a comprehensive service infrastructure and an enhanced IBC protocol into the Tendermint & Cosmos stack, IRISnet enables service interoperability as well as token transfers across an internet of blockchains.
As the centerpiece of IRISnet, IRIS Hub (a.k.a. IRIShub) will be the first re- gional hub connecting to the main Cosmos Hub, thus making IRISnet an inseparable part of the whole Cosmos network.
