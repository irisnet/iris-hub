# Genesis File

The Genesis file is the basis for the entire network initialization，which contains most info for creating a Genesis block (such as ChainID, consensus params,app state), initialize account balances, parameters for each module, and validators info.
The genesis file sets the initial parameters of any new IRIS network. Establishing a robust social consensus over the genesis file is critical to starting a network.

Each genesis state starts with a list of account balances. Social consensus on these account balances must be bootstrapped from some external process be it events on another blockchain to a token generation event.

## Basic State

* **genesis_time** The time to build Genesis file
* **chain_id**     Blockchain’s ID

## Consensus Params

* **block_size** 
  * `max_bytes` The max size of a block
  * `max_gas`  The maximum Gas quantity of a block. Its default value is -1 which means no gas limit. If the accumulation of comsumed gas exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction and all subsequent transactions in the same block will fail to deliver. 
* **evidence**   The lifecycle of deception evidence in the block

## App State

* **accounts** Initialization account info

* **auth** Params related to the system 
  * params Detail in [Gov-Params](gov-params.md#parameters-in-auth)

* **stake** Params related to the staking consensus
  * pool   The total of the current bonded token
  * validators   All the information of validators 
  * params Detail in [Gov-Params](gov-params.md#parameters-in-stake)
  
* **mint**  Params related to inflation
  * params Detail in [Gov-Params](gov-params.md#parameters-in-mint)
  
* **distribution** Params related to distribution & commission
  * params Detail in [Gov-Params](gov-params.md#parameters-in-distribution)
  
* **gov**  Params related to on-chain governance
  * params Detail in [Governance.md](../governance.md#interactive-process)

* **upgrade** Params related to upgrade
  * GenesisVersion Initialize the genesis version

* **slashing** Params related to slashing validators
  * params Detail in [Gov-Params](gov-params.md#parameters-in-slashing)
  
* **service**  Params related to service
  * params Detail in [Gov-Params](gov-params.md#parameters-in-service)
  
* **guardian** Params related to guardian
  * `profilers` The profiler list
  * `trustees` The trustees list
  
## Gentxs

Gentxs contains the transaction set of creating validators in genesis block. 
The IRIS SDK provides robust tools for bootstrapping the identities that will start chain via the gen-tx process. gen-tx or a Genesis Transaction are cryptographically signed transactions that are executed during chain initialization that generate a starting set of validators.
The gen-txs are artifacts that prove that the holders of accounts consent in launching the network and that they putting capital at risk in the process.
