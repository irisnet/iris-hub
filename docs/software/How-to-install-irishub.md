#### Compile Source Code

- Get the code and compile Iris

After setting up Go correctly, you should be able to compile and run `iris`.
Make sure that your server can access to google.com because our project depends on some libraries provided by google.

* To compile for `testnet`:
Please checkout the latest version，refer to：https://github.com/irisnet/irishub/releases/latest
```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/irisnet
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/irisnet
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/irishub
cd irishub && git checkout <latest_iris_version>
make get_tools
source scripts/setTestEnv.sh
make all
```

* To compile for `betanet`:
```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/irisnet
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/irisnet
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/irishub
cd irishub && git checkout <latest_iris_version>
make get_tools
make all
```

If your environment variables have set up correctly, you should not get any errors by running the above commands.
Now check your `iris` version.

```
$ iris version
<latest_iris_version>
    
$ iriscli version
<latest_iris_version>
```
