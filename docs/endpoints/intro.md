## An Overview of All Endpoints and SDKs

Each node can be configured with the following endpoints, and each type of endpoint is served on a different port for users to interact with a node. And we provide IRIShub client SDKs to facilitate developers to develop applications more conveniently. Details on how to configure each endpoint and SDKs is provided in their own section.
