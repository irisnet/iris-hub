# Online Governance In IRISHub

## What is onchain governance?

On-chain governance is used for validators to modify the parameters of certain modules.

### Types of Governance Proposal

* Text
* System Parameter Change
* Protocol Upgrade [not implemented]

## Governance Process

The governance process is divided in a few steps that are outlined below:

* Proposal submission: Proposal is submitted to the blockchain with a deposit.
* Vote: Once deposit reaches a certain value (MinDeposit), proposal is confirmed and vote opens. Bonded Atom holders can then send TxGovVote transactions to vote on the proposal.
* If the proposal is passed, then there sill be some changes. 


For `System Parameter Change` proposals, the following parameters are eligible for change:

* Mininimum Depost: `1000IRIS` or `1000000000000000000000iris`
* Deposit Period: 1440 blocks
* Penalty for non-voting validtors: 1%
* Pass Threshold: 50%
* Voting Period: 20000 blocks

## How to submit a proposal?

Anyone could submit a governance proposal, but you need to make the deposit for this proposal more than the minimium requirement.

The following command is for submitting a `Text` proposal:

```
iriscli gov submit-proposal --title="Text" --description="name of the proposal" --type="Text" --deposit="1000000000000000000000iris" --proposer=<account>  --from=<name>  --chain-id=fuxi-3000 --fee=400000000000000iris --gas=20000 --node=http://localhost:36657
```

> Please Note the `deposit` is in minimum unit.

The `<account>` for `proposer` field should start with `faa` which corresponds to `<name>`.


## How to add deposit to a proposal?

To add deposit to some proposal, you could execute this command to add `10IRIS` to the proposal's deposit:

```
iriscli gov deposit --proposalID=1 --depositer=<account> --deposit=1000000000000000000iris   --from=<name>  --chain-id=fuxi-3000  --fee=400000000000000iris --gas=20000  --node=http://localhost:36657 
```

## How to vote a proposal?

In the current version of governance module, you have the following choices for each proposal:
* Yes
* No
* NoWithVeto
* Abstien

You could put one of the choices in the `--option` field. 

To vote for a proposal, you need to get the correct `<proposal_id>`.You could execute the following command to vote on proposal with ID = 1:
```
iriscli  vote --from=jerry --voter=<account> --proposalID=1 --option=Yes --chain-id=fuxi-3000
   --fee=2000000000000000iris --gas=20000  --node=http://localhost:36657
```

## How to get more information about a proposal?

You could use the following command to get the first proposal:  
```
iriscli gov query-proposal --proposalID=1 --chain-id=fuxi-3000 --node=http://localhost:26657

```
