# IRIShub Network

## How to Join IRIShub Mainnet

### Step 1: Install `iris` on Your Server

Please follow this [instruction](../software/How-to-install-irishub.md) to get `iris` installed locally.

### Step 2: Run a Full Node

Please follow this [instruction](Full-Node.md) to get your full node running.


### Step 3: Upgrade to Validator Node

You now have an active full node. What's the next step? 

If you have participated in the genesis file generation process, you should be a validator once you are fully synced. 

If you miss the genesis file generation process, you can still upgrade your full node to become an IRISnet Validator. The top 100 validators have the ability to propose new blocks to the IRIS Hub. 

Please follow this [instruction](Validator-Node.md) to upgrade your full node to validator node.

### Deploy IRIShub Monitor

Please follow this [guide](../software/monitor.md) to get IRIHub monitor running on your side.

### Setup a sentry node

A validator is under the risk of being attacked. You could follow this [guide](../software/sentry.md) to setup a sentry node to protect yourself.

### Using a KMS
If you plan to use a KMS (key management system), you should go through these steps first: [Using a KMS](../software/kms/kms.md).
