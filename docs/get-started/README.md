## What is IRISnet

IRIS network (a.k.a. IRISnet) is named after Greek goddess **Iris**, said to be the personification of the rainbow and the faithful messenger between heaven and humanity. IRIS network aims to build the foundation which facilitates construction of distributed business applications.

## How to Join Fuxi Testnet

### Step 1: Install Iris on Your Server

Please follow this [instruction](Install-the-Software.md) to get **Iris** installed locally.

### Step 2: Run a Full Node

Please follow this [instruction](Full-Node.md) to get your full node running.


### Step 3: Upgrade to Validator Node

Please follow this [instruction](Validator-Node.md) to upgrade your full node to validator node.

### Deploy IRISHub Monitor

Please follow this [guide](../software/monitor.md) to get IRIHub monitor running on your side.


### Upgrade to Validator Node

You now have an active full node. What's the next step? 

If you have participated in the genesis file generation process, you should be a validator once you are fully synced. 

If you miss the genesis file generation process, you can still upgrade your full node to become a IRISnet Validator. The top 100 validators have the ability to propose new blocks to the IRIS Hub. Continue onto [the Validator Setup](Validator-Node.md).

### Setup a sentry node

A validator is under the risk of being attacked. You could follow this [guide](../software/sentry.md) to setup a sentry node to protect yourself.
