## Extended description

1. Any user can deposit some tokens to submit a proposal. Once the deposit reaches a certain value `min_deposit`, the proposal enter voting period, otherwise it will remain in the deposit period. Others can deposit the proposals in the deposit period. Once the sum of the deposit reaches `min_deposit`, the proposal enter voting period. However, if the block-time exceeds `max_deposit_period` in the deposit period, the proposal will be closed.
2. The proposals which enter voting period only can be voted by validators.
