## Extended description

1. Any users can deposit some tokens to initiate a proposal. Once deposit reaches a certain value `min_deposit`, enter voting period, otherwise it will remain in the deposit period. Others can deposit the proposals on the deposit period. Once the sum of the deposit reaches `min_deposit`, enter voting period. However, if the block-time exceeds `max_deposit_period` in the deposit period, the proposal will be closed.
2. The proposals which enter voting period only can be voted by validators and delegators. The vote of a delegator who hasn't vote will be the same as his validator's vote, and the vote of a delegator who has voted will be remained. The votes wil be tallyed when reach `voting_period'.
